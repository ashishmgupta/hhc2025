    Oh hi! Am I on the road again? I should buy souvenirs for the family.
    Loud shirts? Love them. Because - hey, if you aren't having fun, what are you even doing??
    And yes, finger guns are 100% appropriate for military portraits.
    ... We should get dessert soon!
    Welcome to my little corner of network security! finger guns
    I've whipped up something sweeter than my favorite whoopie pie - an interactive firewall simulator that'll teach you more in ten minutes than most textbooks do in ten chapters.
    Don't worry about breaking anything; that's half the fun of learning!
    Ready to dig in?
